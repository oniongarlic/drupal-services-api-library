A PHP class for accessing Drupal trough the services REST API module, https://www.drupal.org/project/services

Will support all node operations and file uploads. Other API endpoints if/when required.

Only JSON is supported so that response format must be enabled in services settings.

For examples on how to use the class, see the various test scripts.

Have fun!
